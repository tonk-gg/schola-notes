AKA Fermat's remainder theorem

If $p$ is a prime number and $a$ is an integer not divisible by $p$ ($p\nmid a$), then $a$ raised to the power $p-1$ is congruent to $1$ modulo $p$.
$$a^p\equiv a \text{ (mod p)}\Rightarrow a^{p-1}\equiv1\text{ (mod p)}$$
Also expressed as:$$p\mid a^p-a.$$Provable by [[Euler's Theorem]].
