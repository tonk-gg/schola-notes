A group $G$ under binary operation $*$, a subset of $H$ of $G$ is a *subgroup* of $G$ if $H$ also forms a group under operation $*$. Precisely, $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ if the restriction of $*$ to $H\times H$ is a group operation on $H$, denoted as $H\leq G$.

The *trivial subgroup* of any group is the subgroup $\{e\}$ consisting of just the identity element.

A *proper subgroup* of a group $G$ is a subgroup $H$ which is a *proper subset* of $G$ ($H\neq G$).
