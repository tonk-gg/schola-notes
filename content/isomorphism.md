# isomorphism
see also: [[1725899418-automorphism|automorphisms]]
Fundamental concept in abstract algebra. Allow us to identify when two seemingly different mathematical structures are essentially the same.

## Definition
- An isomorphism is a structure-preserving bijective map between two mathematical objects of the same type
- If there exists an isomorphism between two structures, we say they are isomorphic

## Properties of Isomorphisms
- Bijective (one-to-one and onto)
- Structure-preserving (respects the operations defined on the objects)
- Has an inverse that is also an isomorphism

## Types of Isomorphisms
- Group Isomorphisms
    - A bijective map $\varphi$: $G \rightarrow H$ between groups such that $\varphi(ab)=\varphi(a)\varphi(b)$ for all $a,b$ in $G$
    - Preserves the group operation
- Ring Isomorphisms
    - Preserves both addition and multiplication
    - For rings $R$ and $S$, a bijective map $\varphi$: $R \rightarrow S$ such that: $\varphi(a+b)=\varphi(a)+\varphi(b)$ and $\varphi(ab)=\varphi(a)\varphi(b)$ for all $a,b$ in $R$
- Field Isomorphisms
    - Similar to ring isomorphisms, but between [[fields]]
    - Also preserves [[1725555801-modular-multiplicative-inverse|multiplicative inverse]]
- Vector Space Isomorphisms
    - Linear bijections between vector spaces
    - Preserve vector addition and scalar multiplication

## Isomorphism Theorems
Several important isomorphism theorems in algebra that relate quotient structures to substructures:
- First Isomorphism Theorem (for groups): $G/\text{ker}(\varphi)\cong\text{im}(\varphi)$ for any [[homomorphism]] $\varphi$
- Similar theories exist for [[rings]] and other algebraic structures

## Properties Preserved by Isomorphisms
- Order of elements in groups
- Cyclic nature of groups
- Commutativity
- Characteristic of rings/fields
- Dimension of vector spaces

## Isomorphism vs. Equality
- Isomorphic objects are not necessarily equal, but they share all structural properties. This distinction is crucial in abstract mathematics.

## Computational Aspects
- Determining whether two structures are isomorphic can be computationally challenging. The graph isomorphism problem, for instance, is a famous problem in computational complexity theory.

## Categories and Isomorphisms
- In category theory, isomorphisms are defined more generally as morphisms that have two-sided inverses. This generalizes the concept to a wide range of mathematical structures.

## Natural Isomorphisms
- In category theory, a natural isomorphism is an isomorphism between functors. This concept is crucial in understanding how different constructions in mathematics relate to each other.
