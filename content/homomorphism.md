# homomorphism
A structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type (e.g., two rings, two groups, two fields). While their elements may appear completely different, results on one system often apply to the other. Homomorphism enables useful simplifications. For example, proving homomorphism between two structures enables the mapping of known behaviours and characteristics from one system onto the other.

## Definition
A map $f:A\rightarrow B$ between two sets, $A, B$ have the same structure such that, if $\cdot$ is an operation of the structure, then:
$$f(x\cdot y)=f(x)\cdot f(y)$$
for every pair $x,y$ of elements of $A$.
