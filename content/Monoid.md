A set $S$ with binary operation $S\times S\rightarrow S$, denoted as $*$, is a monoid if it satisfies the following two axioms:
**Associativity**
For all $a,b$ and $c$ in $S$, the equation $(a*b)*c=a*(b*c)$ holds.
**Identity Element**
There exists an element $e$ in $S$ s.t. for every element $a$ in $S$, the equalities $e*a=a$ and $a*e=a$ hold.
