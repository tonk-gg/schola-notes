# Reed-Solomon Codes
A class of powerful and widely used error-correcting codes. Often applied in digital communication and storage.

## Basic Concept
- Block codes that treat data as a sequence of symbols rather than individual bits
- They are particularly effective at correcting burst errors (errors affecting multiple consecutive bits or symbols)

## Key Properties
- *Non-binary* — RS codes operate on multi-bit symbols, typically 8 bits (1 byte) per symbol
- *Cyclic* — the code is invariant under cyclic shifts
- *Linear* — any linear combination of codewords is also a codeword

## Mathematical Foundation
- Based on [[finite fields|finite field]] (Galois field) arithmetic, typically $GF(2^m)$ where $m$ is the number of bits per symbol
- Codewords are treated as polynomials over this finite field

## Code Parameters
- `n`: total number of symbols in a codeword
- `k`: number of data symbols
- `2t=n-k`: number of parity symbols, where `t` is the error-detection capability

## Encoding Process
- Data is treated as coefficients of a polynomial
- This polynomial is multiplied by $x^{(n-k)}$
- The remainder when divided by a generator polynomial is added to create the codeword

## Decoding Process
- [[Syndrome calculation]]
- Error locator polynomial determination (e.g., using [[Berlekamp-Massey algorithm]])
- Finding error locations (e.g., using [[Chien search]])
- Error value calculation (e.g., using [[Forney algorithm]])
- Error correction

## Error Correction Capability
- Can correct up to $t$ symbol errors in known locations (erasures)
- Can correct up to $t/2$ symbol errors in unknown locations

## Advantages
- Excellent for burst error correction
- Flexible: can be adapted for different symbol sizes and code rates
- Well-understood mathematically, with efficient encoding and decoding algorithms

## Applications
- Storage systems: CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray discs, QR codes
- Digital television (DVB, ATSC)
- Data transmission: deep space communication, satellite communication
- RAID 6 storage systems

## Variations and Enhancements
- Shortened RS codes: Adapt the code for smaller block sizes
- Concatenated codes: RS codes combined with other codes (e.g., convolutional codes)
- Soft-decision decoding: Improves performance by using probabilistic information

## Implementation Considerations
- Finite field arithmetic can be implemented efficiently using lookup tables
- Hardware implementations can achieve high-speed encoding and decoding

## Simple Python Implementation
```python
import galois

# Define the field GF(2^8)
GF = galois.GF(2**8)

def rs_encode(message, n, k):
    # Create generator polynomial
    g = galois.Poly([1], field=GF)  # Start with x^0
    for i in range(n - k):
        g *= galois.Poly([1, GF.primitive_element ** i], field=GF)
    
    # Pad message with zeros
    msg_poly = galois.Poly(message + [0] * (n - k), field=GF)
    
    # Divide x^(n-k) * message by generator polynomial
    _, remainder = divmod(msg_poly * galois.Poly([1] + [0] * (n - k), field=GF), g)
    
    # Combine message and remainder to form codeword
    codeword = list(msg_poly.coeffs)
    codeword[-len(remainder):] = remainder.coeffs
    
    return codeword

# Example usage
n, k = 15, 11  # (15,11) Reed-Solomon code
message = GF([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11])  # 11 data symbols
codeword = rs_encode(message, n, k)
print("Message:", message)
print("Codeword:", codeword)
```
