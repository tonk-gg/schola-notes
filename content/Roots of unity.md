# Roots of unity
Fundamental concept in complex analysis, algebra, and number theory. Important applications in signal processing, cryptography, and other fields.

## Definition
- Complex number $z$ is an nth root of unity if $z^n=1$, where $n$ is a positive integer

## Primitive Roots of Unity
- A primitive root of unity is an nth root of unity that is not a kth root of unity for any $k \lt n$

## Properties
- There are exactly $n$ distinct nth roots of unity for any positive integer $n$
- The nth roots of unity form a cyclic group under multiplication
- The sum of all nth roots of unity is zero for $n \gt 1$

## Formula
- The nth roots of unity are given by the formula:
    - $z_k=e^{(2 \pi ik/n)}=\cos{(2 \pi k/n)} + i\sin{(2 \pi k/n)}$ where $k=0,1,2,\dots,n-1$

## Geometric Interpretation
- The nth roots of unity are evenly spaced points on the unit circle in the complex plane

## Examples
- Square roots of unity: $1$ and $-1$
- Cube roots of unity: $1$
