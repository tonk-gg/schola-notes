# Polynomial Arithmetic
## Addition and Subtraction
Add or subtract the coefficients of like terms.

Example: $(3x² + 2x + 1) + (x² - x + 4) = 4x² + x + 5$

## Multiplication
Use the distributive property and combine like terms.

Example: $(x + 2)(x - 3) = x² - 3x + 2x - 6 = x² - x - 6$

## Division
Long division or synthetic division for dividing by linear factors.
