Algebraic structures with two binary operations $F(+,*)$ s.t.:
- [[Abelian group]] under $+$
- Non-zero numbers $F-0$ form abelian group under $*$
- Multiplicative distribution over $+$
> [!note]
> Fields can also be defined as commutative ring $(R,+,*)$ with existence of inverse under $*$. Thus, every field can be classified as a [[rings|ring]].

Examples:
- $Q,R,C$ (set of rational, real, and complex numbers) are all fields
- $Z$ is not a field
- $Z/nZ$ forms a finite field under modulo addition and multiplication
