A group $G$ is a set algebraic structure with the binary operation $*$ that combines two elements $a,b$ in the set to produce a third element $a*b$ in the set. The operation has the following properties:
1. *Closure* — $a*b=c\in G$
2. *Associative* — $(a*b)*c=a*(b*c)$
3. *Existence of Identity element* — $a*0=0*a=a$
4. *Existence of inverse element for every element of set* — $a*b=0$
5. *Commutativity (only Abelian groups)* — $a*b=b*a$

Examples
- $Z$ is a group under addition defined as $(Z,+)$
- $(Z/nZ)^\times$ is a finite group under multiplication
- Equilateral triangles for non-abelian group of order 6 under symmetry
- Invertible $n\times n$ for a non-abelian group under multiplication
\*need to explain last two

A subset of $G$ is a [[subgroup]] of $G$ if the members of subset from a group with respect to the group operation in $G$.
